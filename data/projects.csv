K-Scaffold,Roll20 / Character Sheets,large,JS / PUG,kscaffold.png,K-Scaffold mixins,A scaffold for creating Roll20 character sheets using PUG and javascript. Automates many common sheet creation tasks,"Building character sheets is difficult. There's thousands of lines of html, CSS, and Javascript to write and keep track of. The sheet author community has switched to using PUG to write the majority of html code because it simplifies the HTML coding part of creating a sheet. PUG allows us to do many powerful things, including creating reusable bits of code for things that we need frequently.

The K-Scaffold provides a comprehensive library of PUG mixins for frequently used generic HTML constructions. It also provides a powerful link between your PUG code and the javascript sheetworkers that will power your sheet by allowing you to link attributes to functions directly in the PUG that creates them.",https://github.com/Kurohyou/Roll20-Snippets/tree/main/K_Scaffold,https://kurohyou.github.io/Roll20-Snippets/
Roll20 Autocode,"Roll20, Extensions",small,"JS,Jquery,CSS,HTML",r20auto.PNG,Roll20 Autocode interface,A chrome extension that automates the uploading of character sheet and API script code to the Roll20 sandbox.,"Back when the sheet sandbox was first released, I had asked Kenton why the sheet sandbox couldn't simply monitor a directory and automatically update the sandbox when the html, css, or translation.json files changed. Back then, this wasn't possible as browsers don't generally have live access to the file system of a user's computer. That changes today with the release of v1.0 of the Roll20 API and Sheet Autouploader! You can also find the source code on github.

v1.21Alpha of the autouploader also works on API scripts!",https://github.com/Kurohyou-Studios/R20AutoCode,https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/roll20-api-and-sheet-auto/hboggmcfmaakkifgifjbccnpfmnegick
